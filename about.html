                    <p>
                      My name is <strong>Addy López</strong>. I am a front-end
                      developer from Las Vegas, Nevada, and currently based in
                      Albuquerque, New Mexico. In my projects, I'm interested in
                      exploring <em>the creative potential of coding</em>. To
                      me, coding is not only an essential tool for rendering
                      professional services but also an expressive medium for
                      the exchange of ideas, the transmission of knowledge, and
                      the diffusion of culture. In designing this personal
                      website, for example, I drew inspiration from the ancient
                      material culture of the Southwest. My family has deep
                      roots here, and as I built this website, I began
                      reflecting on my own role as a 21st-century participant in
                      a millenium of design in these lands. The background
                      images are geometric motifs that I extracted from

                      bottomless vessel--not for storing water or grain, but for
                      storing our ideas, what we value, and who we are. If you

              <h3>
                What inspired you to learn coding? How did your background lead
                you to this new field of study?
              </h3>
              <p>
                The determination to pursue this line of work arose in me after
                the turning point in my life, when I let go of self-limiting
                attitudes and opened decisively toward transformative
                change--toward cultivating in myself the very qualities that I
                wanted most deeply to see in the world around me. As a deep
                personal expression of that commitment to my values, I became a
                full-time caretaker of my 101-year-old grandmother to ease the
                burden on my mother, who was also juggling a full-time job and
                needed more support. In the midst of the pandemic, as I looked
                into opportunities to further my education through remote
                learning, I discovered
                <a
                  href="https://www.shecodes.io/"
                  target="_blank"
                  title="To SheCodes Home Page"
                  >SheCodes</a
                >, and a door opened for me. SheCodes “teaches coding skills to
                busy women” and is dedicated to diversifying the male-dominated
                tech industry. With its sensitivity to the various circumstances
                that impede women's professional advancement, SheCodes offered
                me the affordability and flexible schedule I needed as a
                caretaker to work towards a viable career without abandoning my
                family responsibilities. Although my lived experience and
                identity don't exactly align with those of cisgendered women, as
                a queer feminist, I see myself in deep political and human
                solidarity with all women. And, since a guarded public face
                contributes minimally at best to making the tech industry or the
                wider world more inclusive, please know that I am proud to be a
                gender-nonconforming lesbian of mixed European and Indigenous
                ancestry ("Hispanic") entering the tech field. I hope that in
                saying so I was able to open the door for another, in turn, and
                help make it easier for you to be free and who you are, too!

              <h3>
                Do you enjoy learning languages, and has that helped you learn
                programming?
              </h3>
              <p>
                I love studying languages! Actually, before I moved to
                Albuquerque, I spent a year teaching in the bilingual program
                (English/Spanish) of a high school in Torrelavega in northern
                Spain. I also taught an adult class and freelanced as a private
                language instructor in Santander when I wasn't skateboarding
                badly along the coast to the beach. My students really inspired
                me to think creatively and tap into my own passion for learning
                in order to empathize with their experience and design
                memorable, interactive lessons for them. So when I returned to
                the United States, I felt a strong desire to be a student again.
                I definitely believe that a strong grasp of linguistic concepts
                and grammatical categories has helped me quickly learn to
                identify how different patterns of code function. But learning a
                programming language is not nearly as challenging as learning a
                spoken language--and making a mistake is far less mortifying!
              </p>

              <h3>
                As a student of the humanities, do you feel at a disadvantage in
                the tech industry without a degree in computer science?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Not whatsoever. Even more helpful to entering this field than my
                experience in studying languages was my undergraduate training
                in critical thinking. I completed my Bachelor of Arts in
                comparative arts with a minor in art history and archaeology at
                Washington University in St. Louis in 2015. My interdisciplinary
                major was nested in the comparative literature department and
                involved the joint study of literature, languages, the visual
                arts, history, critical theory, and music. I learned how to
                parse and analyze the relations between structure and content
                across various media/texts and to develop arguments for the
                interpretation of their meaning. Front-end development has
                strong textual and visual components that I feel at home with,
                given this background. It requires a lot of attention to
                structural details, the recognition of semantic patterns, and
                flexibility in approaching unforseen problems. The "information
                architechture" of a web page is much less mystifying if you can
                compare it to a well-structured research paper and recognize
                that many principles of clear writing carry over to coding good
                HTML. Moreover, in dealing with the presentation of images,
                other media, and text, I find it extremely useful to be able to
                put them in cultural context and move beyond
                <em>“That's cool!”</em> or <em>“That's interesting!”</em> to
                <em>“That's significant, and here's why.”</em>

              <h3>What about coding is most challenging or fun?</h3>
              <p>
                I heard in an interview with a software engineer at
                <a
                  href="https://www.codecademy.com/"
                  target="_blank"
                  title="To Codecademy Home Page"
                  >Codecademy</a
                >, one of the learning platforms I use, that being a software
                engineer means being a professional learner. The current of
                technological change is so swift that you can easily feel swept
                up in the undertow, overwhelmed by the sheer number of skills
                you have to acquire and the pressure to keep pace with the
                industry. It's almost inevitable that much of what we developers
                spend so much time learning will become obsolete, so this
                profession isn't for resting on your laurels! It requires a
                steadfast commitment to your own growth and renewal. Patience
                and persistence in equal measure are key. I strive to bring
                forth those qualities in all that I do. And while the prospect
                of a lifelong learning sentence might feel daunting to others,
                to me, that's precisely the appeal. The opportunity to learn
                each day is one of the reasons I get out of bed in the morning.
                When I am learning and also solving problems, I feel like I am
                tapping into what I do best and channeling my passion for life.
                Strangely enough, "challenging" and "fun" are often synonymous
                to me, and the way toward understanding brings me great peace
                and fulfillment. (You might see these dimensions of my character
                reflected in
                <a

                  >my very first coding project</a

                opportunity to make meaningful use of my talents.

                What do you intend to do in the future with your new coding
                skills?
              </h3>
              <p>
                With respect to employment in the near future, I will probably
                work remotely at first, perhaps freelancing. But I also want
                experience working on a highly competent team at a
                values-aligned company or organization. Not only will that help
                me use my skills to collaborate with a broader professional
                community of amazing people I have yet to meet, but, over time,
                it will give me an opportunity to gain valuable insight into how
                applications and platforms that are complex beyond what a single
                coder can maintain actually get built and how they are run. I
                think it would be a fascinating base of knowledge for eventually
                learning System Design. To me, the more perplexing the problem,
                the more gratifying the solution! I can see myself owning my own
                business or helping others improve theirs. For now, though, I am
                working toward becoming a full-stack engineer, and I'm focused

              <h3>How do you spend your time when you're not coding?</h3>
              <p>
                DRUMMING! Yes, I forgot to mention... I am pursuing two careers
                in parallel but along separate timelines--and both in
                male-dominated industries. I have a dedicated somatic art
                practice and spend time each day on the slow crawl towards
                becoming a fully realized professional musician, a lifelong
                dream of mine. To tell the truth, coding appeared to me in a
                flash of insight as the perfect solution for me to leverage my
                unique talents to lead a creative life, support myself, and live
                well without having to starve for my art. I believe that the
                technical skills I'm learning will help me protect my artistic
                independence and creative autonomy as digital culture evolves
                and that sooner or later these two life pursuits will become
                mutually supporting. Along the way, I found out that I actually
                love coding! I've also discovered that there are a lot of
                appealing similarities between the drumming and coding worlds: a
                professional community of resourceful life-long learners, use of
                an abstract and logical notational system, rich creative
                possibilities, and no end to the skills to master.... Ask me
                about the rest if we ever sit down together to chat! My mom
                affectionately calls them my two "black-hole careers," which
                makes me laugh. The question should have been,
                <em
                  >“How do you spend your time when you're not drumming or
                  coding?”</em
                >
                That's simple! Listening to music, reading, FaceTiming my twin
                sister, or taking my fierce and adorable bow-wow, Hiroshi, for a
                walkie in the Bosque!
