                  My name is <strong>Addy López</strong>, and I am a front-end
                  developer currently based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In my
                  projects, I am interested in exploring
                  <em>the creative potential of coding</em>. To me, coding is
                  not only an essential tool for rendering professional services
                  but also an expressive medium for the exchange of ideas, the
                  transmission of knowledge, and the diffusion of culture. In
                  designing this personal website, for example, I drew
                  inspiration from the ancient material culture of the
                  Southwest. My family has deep roots here, and as I built this
                  website, I began reflecting on my own role as a 21st-century
                  participant in a millenium of design in these lands. The
                  background images are geometric motifs that I extracted from

            What inspired you to learn coding? How did your background lead you
            to this new field of study?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The determination to pursue this line of work arose in me after the
            turning point in my life, when I let go of self-limiting attitudes
            and opened decisively toward transformative change--toward
            cultivating in myself the very qualities that I wanted most deeply
            to see in the world around me. As a deep personal expression of that
            commitment to my values, I became a full-time caretaker of my
            101-year-old grandmother to ease the burden on my mother, who was
            also juggling a full-time job and needed more support. In the midst
            of the pandemic, as I looked into opportunities to further my
            education through remote learning, I discovered
            <a
              href="https://www.shecodes.io/"
              target="_blank"
              title="To SheCodes Home Page"
              >SheCodes</a
            >, and a door opened for me. SheCodes “teaches coding skills to busy
            women” and is dedicated to diversifying the male-dominated tech
            industry. With its sensitivity to the various circumstances that
            impede women’s professional advancement, SheCodes offered me the
            affordability and flexible schedule I needed as a caretaker to work
            towards a viable career without abandoning my family
            responsibilities. Although my lived experience and identity don’t
            exactly align with those of cisgendered women, as a feminist, I see
            myself in deep political and human solidarity with all women. And,
            since a guarded public face contributes minimally at best to making
            the tech industry or the wider world more inclusive, please know
            that I am proud to be a gender-nonconforming lesbian of mixed
            European and Indigenous ancestry entering the tech field. I hope
            that in saying so I was able to open the door for another, in turn.

            Do you enjoy learning languages, and is that the appeal of
            programming?
          </h3>
          <p>
            [PARAGRAPH ANSWERING THE ABOVE QUESTION: I spent a year teaching in
            the bilingual program (English/Spanish) of a highschool in northern
            Spain. Reverse-engineered my lessons, reasoning toward solid
            teaching principles from what qualities make for effective learning.
            Attention to detail, syntax, etc. I also freelanced as a private
            instructor. ]I once taught myself Italian for a girl, so in
            comparison, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were a piece of cake!
            [laughing]
          </p>
          <h3>What about coding is most challenging or fun?</h3>
          <p>
            I heard in an interview with a software engineer at
            <a
              href="https://www.codecademy.com/"
              target="_blank"
              title="To Codecademy Home Page"
              >Codecademy</a
            >, one of the learning platforms I use, that being a software
            engineer means being a professional learner. The current of
            technological change is so swift that you can easily feel swept up
            in the undertow, overwhelmed by the sheer number of skills you have
            to acquire and the pressure to keep pace with the industry. It's
            almost inevitable that much of what we developers spend so much time
            learning will become obsolete, so this profession isn't for resting
            on your laurels! It requires a steadfast commitment to your own
            growth and renewal. But while the prospect of a lifelong learning
            sentence might feel daunting to others, to me, that's precisely the
            appeal. The opportunity to learn each day is one of the reasons I
            get out of bed in the morning. When I am learning and also solving
            problems, I feel like I am tapping into what I do best and
            channeling my passion for life. Strangely enough, "challenging" and
            "fun" are often synonymous to me, and the way toward understanding
            brings me great peace and fulfillment. (You might see these
            dimensions of my character reflected in
            <a
              href="projects.html#masyu"

              >my very first coding project</a
            >.) I am tremendously grateful that this profession gives me the
            opportunity to make meaningful use of my talents.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What do you intend to do in the future with your new coding skills?
          </h3>
          <p>
            With respect to employment in the near future, I want experience
            working on a highly competent team. Not only will that help me use
            my skills to collaborate with a broader professional community of
            amazing people I have yet to meet, but, over time, it will give me
            an opportunity to gain valuable insight into how applications and
            platforms that are complex beyond what a single coder can maintain
            actually get built and how they are run. I think it would be a
            fascinating base of knowledge for eventually learning System Design.
            To me, the more perplexing the problem, the more gratifying the
            solution! For now, though, I am working toward becoming a full-stack
            engineer, and I'm focused on learning the specific skills that are
            empowering me to carve my own path.
